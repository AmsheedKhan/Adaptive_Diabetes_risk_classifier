# 🧠 Adaptive Learning Systems Repository

Welcome to **Adaptive Learning Systems**, a collection of intelligent machine learning projects that can **self-adapt** to changes in data over time.  
Each project in this repository demonstrates a practical implementation of **adaptive learning principles**, such as **concept drift detection**, **online retraining**, and **data-driven model updates**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Traditional machine learning models degrade when the underlying data distribution changes — this phenomenon is known as **concept drift**.  
Adaptive learning systems address this by:
- Monitoring data streams for drift  
- Automatically retraining or tuning models  
- Maintaining model accuracy and robustness over time  

This repository is dedicated to exploring **adaptive AI systems** that continuously learn, evolve, and optimize themselves.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each folder represents a standalone adaptive project with its own Streamlit or Python-based interface.

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **diabetes_adaptive_app/** | Adaptive model for diabetes prediction using drift detection and retraining |
| **adaptive_stock_predictor/** | (Planned) Adaptive financial forecasting system for real-time stock data |
| **adaptive_weather_forecast/** | (Planned) Adaptive weather prediction system handling changing seasonal patterns |
