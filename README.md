## 🌐 Live Demo  
🚀 **Try it here:**  
👉 [Adaptive Diabetes Risk Prediction System](https://adaptivediabetecrisksystem.streamlit.app/)

Experience an intelligent, adaptive system that predicts diabetes risk and learns from new data in real time.

---

## 📘 Overview  
This repository hosts the **Diabetes Adaptive Learning App**, built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. It analyzes medical attributes and predicts diabetes likelihood while adapting its internal model from uploaded data.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧩 **Adaptive Learning:** Learns continuously from user-uploaded data.  
- 📊 **Interactive Streamlit Interface:** Simple and responsive UI for real-time analysis.  
- 📁 **Custom Dataset Upload:** Supports CSV uploads matching the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset format.  
- ⚙️ **Lightweight Deployment:** Works locally or on Streamlit Cloud seamlessly.  

## 💻 How to Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmsheedKhan/Adaptive_learning_models.git
cd Adaptive_learning_models/Adaptive_Learning_diabetes
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run Adaptive_learning.py
☁️ Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
You can deploy this app directly to the cloud in minutes using Streamlit Community Cloud.

Make sure your repo includes:

Adaptive_learning.py

requirements.txt

📊 Dataset
This app expects a dataset structured like the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
You can upload your own CSV file following the same format for personalized testing and model retraining.
