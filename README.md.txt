# 🧠 Adaptive Learning System - Diabetes Prediction

This project is an **Adaptive Learning System** that predicts diabetes likelihood using machine learning.  
It dynamically learns patterns from user-provided data and adapts its predictions over time.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This app demonstrates how adaptive learning and AI can personalize predictions and decision-making for healthcare data.

The model is based on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and is implemented with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.

## ⚙️ **requirements.txt**
Create another file named `requirements.txt` in the same folder as your Python app:



streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib

## ✅ Next Steps
1. Add both files (`README.md` and `requirements.txt`) to your project folder.  
2. Commit and push them:
   ```bash
   git add README.md requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Added README and requirements for deployment"
   git push


Then go to https://share.streamlit.io
 and connect your repo.

Once connected, you’ll see your app live online! 🌐
