# 🧠 Adaptive Learning System - Diabetes Prediction

This project is an **Adaptive Learning System** that predicts diabetes likelihood using machine learning.  
It dynamically learns patterns from user-provided data and adapts its predictions over time.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This app demonstrates how adaptive learning and AI can personalize predictions and decision-making for healthcare data.

The model is based on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** and is implemented with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.
